- 👋 Hi, I’m @PositiveMojo
- 👀 I’m a Software Engineer who has developed systems for 32 years and am currently designing web applications, Windows Services, and desktop apps using Visual Studio. 
- 🌱 I know most languages and systems pretty well. My current focus is on refining techniques to build better interfaces and more efficient data management.
- 💞️ If you are using Visual Studio, I'm open to collaboration. I'm interested in problem solving, not debating
- 📫 How to reach me ...
